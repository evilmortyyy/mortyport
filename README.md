# Quantum Teleportation of Hex String

This program demonstrates the teleportation of a hex string using the [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) library.

## Usage

python3 mortyteleport.py --hex_string [hex string]

The `--hex_string` option is used to specify the hex string to be encoded and measured.

## Example

`python3 mortyteleport.py --hex_string 01`


This will teleport the hex string "01" and output the initial state and final state of the qubits.

## Output

The program will output the initial state and final state of the qubits, as well as the measurement outcome and whether or not the teleportation was successful.
